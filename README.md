# ANALYSIS-AND-CLASSIFICATION-OF-BIKESHARE-DATA

### Refer bspr_ppt.pdf (https://github.com/sumedhachugh/ANALYSIS-AND-CLASSIFICATION-OF-BIKESHARE-DATA/blob/main/bspr%20ppt.pdf) for short description of what all I have done in the project

DATASET USED:

In this project the data explored is related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Dataset consists of three files:

Chicago.csv, New_york_city.csv and washington.csv

All three of the data files contain the same core six columns:

Start Time

End Time

Trip Duration

Start Station

End Station

User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have two extra columns: Gender and Birth Year.

Descriptive Statistics explored here are:

Popular times of travel: most common month, most common day of week, most common hour of day

Popular stations and trip: most common start station, most common end station, most common trip from start to end

Trip duration: total travel time, average travel time

User info counts of each user type: counts of each gender, earliest year of birth, most recent year of birth, most common year of birth

Classifiers used are: SVM, Gaussian NB, Random Forest and Decision Tree
